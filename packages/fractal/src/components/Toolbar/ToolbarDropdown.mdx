`<Dropdown />` component (and thus on a`<div />` element) (except for
`condensed` and the `trigger`), you can also pass the 'active', 'icon',
'iconOnly', 'iconPosition' and 'label' props of a `<ToolbarButton />` component
that will be used as the trigger of the dropdown.  
Also, you can pass the following props:
