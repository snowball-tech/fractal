# Iconography

---

Fractal uses the [Unicons icon library](https://iconscout.com/unicons) in the
[Line version (free)](https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/line).

## Usage

It's recommended to add the `@tooni/iconscout-unicons-react` package as a
dependency so you can import any Line icon in your React components and use it
as any other React component.

> ##### ðŸ’¡ Tips
>
> ---
>
> The official `react-unicons` library hasn't been updated in a while.
> If you want to enjoy TypeScript support and tree shaking, it's recommended to
> add the
> [Toony's version of the library](https://github.com/tooni/iconscout-unicons-react):
>
> ```bash
> yarn add @tooni/iconscout-unicons-react
> ```

Simply import the icon you need:

```jsx
import { UilIcons } from '@tooni/iconscout-unicons-react'
```

    <div
      key={index}
      className="icon"
      role="button"
      tabIndex={-1}
      title={iconName}
      onClick={() => {
        navigator.clipboard?.writeText(
          `import { ${iconName} } from '@tooni/iconscout-unicons-react'`,
        )
      }}
      onKeyDown={(event) => {
        if (event.key === 'Enter') {
          navigator.clipboard?.writeText(
            `import { ${iconName} } from '@tooni/iconscout-unicons-react'`,
          )
        }
      }}
    >
      <div className="icon-name">{iconName}</div>
      {createElement(icon, { size: 56 })}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
