![Fractal design system](/images/cover_fractal.png)

Fractal is [Snowball's](https://snowball.xyz) design system.

It is a collection of assets, UI components and guidelines that are used to
build products, apps, marketing contents and documentations.

## 🧱 Foundations

The base reference for Fractal is the
[Figma project](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1281271374017743876/%E2%9D%84%EF%B8%8F-Fractal-Design-System).  
All tokens created in Figma are then transformed in the
[`design-tokens` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snowball-tech/design-tokens).  
Finally, those design token are the used inside of the Fractal design system.

> ##### ℹ️ Info

> The design tokens abstraction ensure consistency throughout all the

### Tech stack

- The design principles and guidelines of Fractal are based on
  [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1281271374017743876/%E2%9D%84%EF%B8%8F-Fractal-Design-System).
- The [design tokens](https://github.com/snowball-tech/fractal/tree/main/packages/design-tokens)
  are derived using [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/)
  _(from Amazon)_.
- The Fractal web UI components library is built in
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for
  [React](https://reactjs.org/) applications and
  [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) is used to style all the components
  according to the design tokens.  
  Also, most of the components are based on
  [Radix-UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).
- This documentation website is built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
