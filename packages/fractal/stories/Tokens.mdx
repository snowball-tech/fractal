# Tokens

---

All design values _(colors, breakpoints, shadows, spacings, ...)_ are defined as
design tokens.

You can find those tokens in the
[`design-tokens` directory of the Fractal repository](https://github.com/snowball-tech/fractal/tree/main/packages/design-tokens)

> ##### ℹ️ Info
>
> ---
>
> For more information about design tokens, read the
> [README](https://github.com/snowball-tech/fractal/blob/main/packages/design-tokens/README.md)

For convenience and ease of use, those tokens are translated into usable
resources when developing your application.

## CSS variables

All tokens are exported as CSS variables in the
`@snowball-tech/design-tokens/dist/web/css/variables.css` file
_(exported by the
[`@snowball-tech/design-tokens`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snowball-tech/design-tokens)
package)_.

The variables are named exactly like the corresponding tokens, except that the
"." is replaced by a "-" _(and of course, variables are prefixed with "--")_.

## JavaScript/TypeScript constants

If you need to use a token in your JavaScript/TypeScript code, you can import
any values from the
`@snowball-tech/design-tokens/dist/web/typescript/design-tokens.js` file
_(exported by the
[`@snowball-tech/design-tokens`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snowball-tech/design-tokens)
package)_.

The constants are named exactly like the corresponding tokens but in
[PascalCase](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase)
